      <h2>02.Different Between Regular function And Arrow function ?</h2>
      <p>
        Ans : Regular functions created using function declarations or
        expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are
        constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the
        arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow
        functions can never be used as constructor functions.
